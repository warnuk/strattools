# strattools
Tools for plotting and analyzing stratigraphic data in R. These are a few functions I've developed to help me plot some basic stratigraphic data for my PhD research. It's my hope to compile more tools and develop this into a full-fledged suite of analytical and visualization tools. As of now though, this is a work-in-progress! (i.e. use at your own risk). Feel free to contact me if you have any feature requests and I'll try my hand at them

## Installation
You can install this (preliminary) package using devtools with the following commands in R:
>install.packages('devtools')
>
>devtools::install_github('warnuk/strattools')
